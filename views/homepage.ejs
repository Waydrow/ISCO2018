<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h4>Scopes and Topics</h4>
<p>The International Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization (ISCO) aims for advancing and promoting the theory
    and applications of combinatorial optimization, which is an area of research at the intersection of applied
    mathematics, computer science, and operations research and which overlaps with many other areas such as
    computation complexity, computational biology, VLSI design, communication networks, and management science.
    It includes complexity analysis and algorithm design for combinatorial optimization problems, numerical experiments
    and problem discovery with applications in science and engineering.</p>
<!--<h4>Special Activity</h4>
<p>
    ISCO is dedicated to the 70th birthday of Dingzhu Du, who is a professor at Department of Computer Science,
    University of Texas at Dallas, and the founding editor-in-Chief of Journal of Combinatorial Optimization published by Springer.
